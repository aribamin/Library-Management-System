# Group work break-down strategy
Go over submission requirements as a group <br />
Assign someone to write the work break-down and ensure code execution guide is provided <br />
Create a test db for the queries <- one man job <br />
Python script to execute <- Initial commit, make branches and work on it individually, review changes as a group when merging pull requests <br />
Write tests for functions if time allows <- do it as group if possible, or two people take the job

# Code execution guide
- Python3 main.py "enter db name add .db to end"
